                            Hello! My name is Aaron Ray and this is my page. There are many like it, but this one is mine. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I have lived in and around Chicago most of my life. I grew up in Wilmette, Illinois and then moved to the city to attend DePaul University, where I graduated in 2018. My major was communications with a concentration in media and media production, with a minor in film.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                        I have mainly worked in production and operations during my short career. But I have had the opportunity to work at some really interesting places, like the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Ravinia (an outdoor music venue on the North Shore), and a start up company in the logistics business. My favorite of those was definitely Ravinia, I almost ran over Bob Dylan in a golf cart. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         When I’m not working, I am a big fan of traveling. I studied abroad in Australia and want to hopefully move back at some point if Covid ever ends. My favorite place I have ever been to is hands-down Barcelona.
                        </p>
                        <p>
	                    But if I’m forced to stay domestic, you can usually find me outside somewhere. I’m probably walking, because I hate running, with headphones in and groovy tunes blasting. Or I’m just kickin’ it with the friends and family. 
                        </p>
