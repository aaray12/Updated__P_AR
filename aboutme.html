                        I am a recent graduate of the North Western coding bootcamp where I learned full stack web
                        development. Thought the course we covered HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, React.js,
                        Express.js and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally I graduated from DePaul University where I studied communications and media production
                        with a minor in film. Throughout college and after, I had a number of interesting jobs ranging from
                        a production for Ravinia, visitor services for the MCA, and most recently I worked as an operations
                        coordinator for a local logistic company.

                    <p>
                        While these are all very different jobs in their own right, experiencing them and being exposed to
                        the different work dynamics has helped me develop skills for problem solving in creative ways. And
                        it is the problem solving that I love most about programming. Starting with a complicated problem,
                        breaking it down, and following each bit information to reach a resolution, like a modern day
                        Sherlock Homes, is as exiting as it gets!
